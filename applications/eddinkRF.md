## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

## Vision: The Future of Decentralized Public Goods Funding

Eddink represents a practical approach to retroactive public goods funding, transforming the traditional grant-making process into a transparent, community-driven, and algorithmically-enhanced platform. By combining cutting-edge ink! smart contract technology with battle-tested funding mechanisms learned from Optimism’s 4-year evolution, we’re creating the foundation of a sophisticated retroactive funding platform native to the Polkadot ecosystem.

Every community member should be able to create funding rounds for causes they care about, where projects are evaluated through transparent, algorithmic processes, and where impact is rewarded after it’s been demonstrated, as famously said “It’s easier to agree on the impact of a project based on what they have already done” Each funding cycle becomes not just a distribution mechanism, but a catalyst for ecosystem growth and innovation.

## Why “Eddink”? The Philosophy Behind Permanent Impact

The name “Eddink” combines **Edding markers** (permanent, indelible) with **ink!** (ink! smart contract language), symbolizing our vision of creating permanent, lasting impact through decentralized funding mechanisms.

Just as an Edding marker creates marks that endure, Eddink creates funding decisions that are transparent, immutable, and designed to generate lasting positive impact. This retroactive funding platform serves as the foundation for our broader ambitions: building toward a future where sustainable, community-driven funding mechanisms can support real-world volunteer initiatives and social good—starting with the proven, manageable scope of digital public goods in the Polkadot ecosystem.

### Ink! Ecosystem Impact

Eddink directly addresses a critical gap in the ink! and Polkadot ecosystem: **sustainable, transparent funding for public goods**. The platform will:

**Drive ink! Smart Contract Adoption:**
- Showcase advanced ink! v6 capabilities through real-world financial infrastructure
- Provide a reference implementation for complex multi-contract systems
- Demonstrate ink!'s suitability for governance and funding mechanisms
- Create reusable contract modules for the community (voting systems, fund distribution, project registries)

**Strengthen Ecosystem Infrastructure:**
- Establish transparent funding mechanisms for ink! tooling, libraries, and educational content
- Enable community-driven resource allocation without central gatekeepers
- Create sustainable incentives for developers building public goods
- Foster cross-parachain collaboration through standardized funding rounds

**Generate Demonstrable Business Value:**
- Validated by Optimism's evolution showing >1.0 revenue-to-grant ratios in mature rounds
- Platform fees and premium features provide sustainable operational model
- Incentivize projects that generate ecosystem value (increased TVL, developer activity, transaction volume)
- Create positive feedback loops where funded projects contribute back to the ecosystem

**Enable Community Empowerment:**
- Any community member can create funding rounds for causes they care about
- Transparent, on-chain evaluation criteria reduce subjective bias
- Badge-holder model ensures informed decision-making while maintaining decentralization
- Foundation for future algorithmic evaluation and quadratic funding mechanisms

**Production Readiness & Future Growth:**
- Built for immediate production use with clear sustainability model
- Modular architecture enables seamless upgrades (QF integration, cross-chain expansion, algorithmic evaluation)
- Open-source codebase serves as educational resource and reference implementation
- Designed to scale from initial dozens of projects to thousands as ecosystem matures

# Technical Architecture & User Experience

## Platform Architecture

**CATEGORY:** ink! DApp / Public Goods Infrastructure

**Technology Stack:**

- **Smart Contracts:** ink! v6 with modular funding mechanisms, upgradable via Polkadot governance
- **Frontend:** React/Next.js with Polkadot.js integration for wallet connectivity and on-chain interactions
- **Backend:** Node.js with PostgreSQL for off-chain data indexing (e.g., project descriptions, media links) and API services
- **Authentication:** Polkadot wallet integration (Substrate/EVM accounts) with GitHub OAuth for identity verification
- **Infrastructure:** IPFS for decentralized storage of application materials, dedicated indexing services for transparent data access

### Core Design Principles from Optimism’s Evolution

Our model draws on the lessons of Optimism’s retrofunding evolution while tailoring to Polkadot’s data-rich environment:

- **Voting-Based Foundations with Algorithmic Readiness:** This grant’s scope focuses on structured, badge-holder–driven round voting while laying the technical foundation for future algorithmic evaluation modules. By prioritizing transparency in data collection and evaluation logic now, the transition to algorithmic retrofunding will be seamless and scalable later.
- **Sybil-Resistant Trusted Actor Model:** Identity and validation rely on Polkadot-native primitives for badge holders, enabling integrity during early voting-based rounds and forming the trust layer for later algorithmic aggregation. Projects creators would also need to prove owning the Github repos of their project
- **Gaming Resistance (Future-Ready):** The architecture accommodates multiple evaluators and eventually multiple competing algorithms, which together will resist manipulation as the system scales.

## Progressive Platform Evolution

We designed the platform to evolve naturally as community capacity and data maturity increase:

- **Initial Access:** Simple retrofunding rounds with badge-holder voting and transparent evaluation data.
- **Enhanced Capabilities:** Introduction of algorithmic evaluation tools and weighted voting as data integrity and trust primitives solidify.
- **Full Platform Access:** Integration of quadratic funding, algorithmic scoring modules, and cross-chain coordination for ecosystem-scale retrofunding.

### Core Data Models & API Specifications

**Smart Contract Data Models:**

```rust
// Project Registry
struct Project {
    id: u64,
    owner: AccountId,
    github_verification: bool,
    metadata_hash: Hash,  // IPFS link to full details
    created_at: Timestamp,
    verification_status: VerificationStatus,
}

// Funding Round
struct Round {
    id: u64,
    admin: AccountId,
    total_funds: Balance,
    voting_start: Timestamp,
    voting_end: Timestamp,
    eligible_projects: Vec<u64>,
    badge_holders: Vec<AccountId>,
    status: RoundStatus,
}

// Vote Allocation
struct VoteAllocation {
    badge_holder: AccountId,
    round_id: u64,
    allocations: Vec<(u64, u128)>,  // (project_id, amount)
    timestamp: Timestamp,
}
```

**REST API Endpoints (Backend):**
- `POST /api/projects` - Register new project
- `GET /api/projects/:id` - Retrieve project details
- `POST /api/rounds` - Create funding round
- `GET /api/rounds/:id` - Get round details and participants
- `POST /api/votes` - Submit badge holder vote
- `GET /api/analytics/project/:id` - Project impact metrics
- `GET /api/analytics/round/:id` - Round statistics

### What This Project Will NOT Provide

To manage expectations and scope clearly:

- **Automated Impact Measurement:** Initial version focuses on badge-holder voting; algorithmic impact scoring is planned for future iterations
- **Fiat Currency Integration:** Platform operates exclusively with DOT and parachain tokens; no fiat on/off ramps
- **Legal Compliance Management:** Projects are responsible for their own legal, tax, and regulatory compliance
- **Dispute Resolution System:** No built-in arbitration mechanism; relies on community governance and transparent criteria
- **Token Streaming:** While the architecture supports future integration, continuous payment streams are not part of the initial scope
- **Cross-Chain Deployment:** Initial launch focuses on Polkadot Asset Hub; expansion to other parachains comes in later phases
- **Sybil Resistance Beyond Badge Holders:** Advanced identity verification (e.g., humanity proofs) planned for future, not initial scope
- **Marketing or Business Development Services:** Platform provides funding infrastructure only; project promotion is self-driven

### Business Model & Economic Sustainability

**Revenue Streams:**
- **Platform Fees:** 1-2% fee on funds to cover operational costs recieved from the round creater and additional funding members. We will not charge anything from the end distributed amount to the teams
- **Premium Features:** (Future) Advanced analytics, private rounds, custom branding for DAOs/enterprises
- **Treasury Grants:** Potential future support from Polkadot Treasury as recognized public goods infrastructure ane expansion

**Target Market:**
- Primary: Polkadot/ink! developers building public goods (tooling, infrastructure, education)
- Secondary: Parachain teams seeking to fund ecosystem growth
- Tertiary: DAOs and community organizations requiring transparent funding mechanisms

**Scalability & Growth:**

## Development Overview

## The Eddink! Platform Vision

Eddink moves deliberately from a conceptual framework inspired by Optimism’s RF evolution toward a **foundation-first implementation** for Polkadot’s public goods ecosystem. This grant scope emphasizes building **the essential primitives for community-driven retrofunding**, while the groundwork for **algorithmic scalability** is designed in parallel.

## What We’ve Already Done

- **Research Foundation:** Based on comprehensive analysis of Optimism’s Seasons 4–8, OpenSourceObserver insights, and Atlas App architecture, we identified key success mechanics for transparency, bias reduction, and scalable impact measurement.
- **Bias Reduction & Scalability:** Transitioning from subjective votes to metrics, then algorithms, reduces bias and enables funding across hundreds of projects as data integration matures.
- **Economic Sustainability:** Evidence from Optimism’s journey demonstrates retrofunding’s potential to yield sustainable public goods funding ratios (>1.0 revenue-to-grant), validating Eddink’s model.

## What Happens During the Grant Scope

This grant focuses on the foundational RetroFunding Infra that is needed for the more scalable algorithmic RetroFunding Mechanism/

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1–4):** Build foundation for projects, rounds, and badge-holder voting

**Phase 2 (Weeks 5–8):** Implement the first version of evaluation UI elements, and the FrontEnd
